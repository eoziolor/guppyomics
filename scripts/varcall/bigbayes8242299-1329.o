This is array number 1329
I am picking line 14 from genome file
It is iteration 29 for scaffold NC_024344.1
The chunk size I am picking is 283389 bases long and this is ending at 8218281
The region this defines is 7934893-8218281 from scaffold with length 28338960
\n\n
The file created is NC_024344.1_29.vcf.bgz
I place it in directory /home/eoziolor/guppy/data/varcall/scaffold
